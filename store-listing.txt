This app is a collection of simple games that I wrote for my kids.  It started out as a way to teach myself some new technology.  I wanted a drawing app that allowed someone to draw with multiple fingers at once.  I took that technology and created a game to help teach my son how to write letters.  I expanded upon the concept from there.  Most of the games are designed to be played with a parent.  Some games were created based on what activities my kids were doing.  Others came from my kids' preschool curriculum.  

Here is a list of games:

Trace Letters - Use the screen to trace out letters.  Teach kids how to write the alphabet.
Draw - A simple multi-touch drawing game.
Sight Words - Basic sight works that my kids are learning in daycare
Shapes - Identify the shapes
Colors - Soundboard of colors
Sort Animals - Sort animals between the land and the sea
Christmas Tree - Decorate a Christmas tree
Match Balls - Match the ball with the field/goal/net
Ruler - Teach kids how to measure things
Counting - Count the animals
Directions - Teach kids the 4 directions

If you have any ideas for new games or improvements on these games, feel free to leave a review.  If the concept isn't too hard and it is within my limited graphic design skills, I will try to add it.
